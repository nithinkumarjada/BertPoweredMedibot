im currently 18 4 weeks pregnant afp results came back 141 chance of trisomy 18 at the 12 week ultrasound baby had grown on time from the 9 week ultrasound and had a wide open hand and at the 16 week ultrasound baby was in time head normal size compared to body and hands wide open with that does it seem to have it also my mom had spina bifida so is it possible i carry the gene and it will always be positive,if your baby is growth has been fine for the gestational age then it would suggest that baby has been doing pretty well if a handhands of your baby are open on an ultrasound it is a great indication that it is not trisomy18 babies with trisomy18 cannot open their hands normally if worried you may consider getting another ultrasound scan done to thoroughly look for other features or markers suggestive of chromosomal abnormalities getting amniocentesis done would also help to confirm or rule out genetic problems in baby discuss with your treating doctorgynecologist or genetic specialist for further clarification and assistance take care,['genetic disorders'],1.0

i have been suffering from severe fatigue for most of my life and had my first hypoglycaemia episode when i was about 11 years old i have visited many doctors over the years and had many tests done which all came back normal however i recently decided to measure my own blood sugars at home i ate a high carb meal with a sugary energy drink my sugar level was 5 6 before the meal 7 3 directly after the meal and 2 2 one hour after the meal i can not find any explanation of the rapid change other than gastric dumping syndrome which does not apply to me as i have never had stomach surgery throughout my life i have alsp experienced severe hormonal swings and wondering if this has something to do with it i was diagnosed with pcos at one point then a few months later told i did not have it as my bloods were now normal can anyone help,it is more likely that you have a severe anxiety or ocd about having medical issues which have not been confirmed by your doctors after a proper examination your symptoms are more likely psychogenic it would be best that you consult a psychiatrist and seek proper help to manage your anxiety,['hypoglycemia'],1.0
had prostate removed due to cancer 20 years ago when i was 44 have had a few issues with erectile dysfunction however with viagra cialis or levitra i am able to get a great erection my problem is with the dry orgasm or should i say lack of orgasm for the first year or so after the surgery i could barely tell if i was having an orgasm it has since got a little better but absolutely nothing like it was before when i ejaculated and after 20 years it just seems like it continues to dwindle i have a very high sex drive testosterone was recently checked and it is abnormally high for someone my age but my orgasms are hardly worth the effort anymore is there anything you can recommend that would or could improve the quality of my dry orgasms i realize they will never ever be the same as they were before without ejaculating but i have talked with other men who have had radical prostatectomies and they do not seem to have any complaints or have this lack of sensation,clubbing is the bulbous enlargement of one or more fingers of the handhands or toetoes of one or both feet due to the proliferation and edema of the connective tissue which result in loss of the normal angle between the nail plate and it is adjacent skin clubbing can both be acquired and familialgenetic there are so many causes of clubbing lung cancer being one of them and not the only cause in your case the clubbing is unilateralinvolves one hand while mostly in lung cancer the clubbing is bilateral also by the time clubbing is evident in moat of the lung cancer patients they have developed all other miserable symptoms of the disease which i hope you do not have unilateral clubbing can occur due to the axillary artery aneurysm or brachial arterio venous malformations so you should probably get these two ruled out first if your clubbing in one hand appeared recently with the other hand being completely fine wishing you the best of health take care and thank you,"['prostate' 'erectile dysfunction' 'lack of sensation' 'testosterone'
