im currently 18 4 weeks pregnant afp results came back 141 chance of trisomy 18 at the 12 week ultrasound baby had grown on time from the 9 week ultrasound and had a wide open hand and at the 16 week ultrasound baby was in time head normal size compared to body and hands wide open with that does it seem to have it also my mom had spina bifida so is it possible i carry the gene and it will always be positive,you seem concerned by the emotional lability during pregnancy along with the feeling that your husband is not supportive and is emotionally and verbally abusing you two main hormones estrogen and progesterone cause mood swings during pregnancy emotions are always unstable and feeling of depression is normal as any other body changes during pregnancy the third trimester is the most anxious one this is the period when mother to be worries about everything and anything that she can think of however her major cause of anxiety lies not just on the labour and delivery process but also in baby care and parenting in general you might be feeling physically uncomfortable with the growth of the abdomen and may feel irritated with the lightest noise as you lack sleep in general it may be more extreme if your partner is unresponsive to your special requirements during pregnancy as he may not realise that the mood swings are normal in pregnancy however if the mood swings of anxiety sadness and anger continuously persist more than two weeks you must meet the practitioner you may be suffering from depression that needs immediate care and attention called bipolar disorder a survey states that untreated emotional health problems can affect your baby is physical well being and increase the risk of preterm labor and postpartum depression get treated with the right psychotherapy and medication for effective results hope this helps take care note this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional,['genetic disorders'],-1.0
well i was power lifting and the bar came down wrong and my wrist popped it hurt a whole lot for a couple days then it went away that is until i lift something even a gallon of milk it hurts the same area as original injury my coaches said it was a sprain yet its been three weeks and still hurts if i lift anything my question is is there something more serious to blame other than a sprain,the history of hearing a pop indicates a soft tissue rupture tendon or ligament and this should not be taken lightly if there is a complete tear the healing will not be complete and surgery would be needed to have ful limb function it would be recommended that you consult with your doctor and get a mri which would help make a proper assessment of your injury and based on that future mode of management can be determined i hope this helps,['orthopedics'],1.0
its been since august 15 2012 and i have had issues the incision in my bellybutton keeps spliting open infection my dr told me no it is not infection did nothing everything i try to eat even one bite it feels like a rubber band is snapping inside when i sleep on my left side everything on the right settles i feel something moving there is an egg sized   in the center between my navel and ribs what could possibly cause the snapping feeling and what could possibly be moving inside me kind of freaked out especially when my dr who is a ta says nothing is wrong i was 110 when this all began i am under 100 lbs i am 5ft 5in and nothing tastes good smells good and i am nausious all the time,it seems you are suffering from reflux and gastritis which is a common issue after gall bladder removal regarding the abnormal feeling it requires a clinical examination to comment regarding the exact cause it might be that the incision site is healing which can cause some hardening of the involved and surrounding region the simple measures that are likely to help you are  1 certain foods such as cauliflower broccoli cabbage brussels sprouts and legumes beans may cause bloating and gassiness 2 dietary fiber may lessen symptoms you should drink plenty of water and avoid soda which may cause gas and abdominal discomfort 3 you can use some over the counter drugs like pepto bismol or tums for symptomatic relief consider visiting the treating surgeon once for evaluation take care,"['bellybutton' 'infection' 'august' 'sleep' 'sleep disorders'

my sister is a 31 year old female she has had very dark stool along with mucus in it for about a year she has abdominal pain and has also been feeling very tired and run down her dr ran a cbc on her and found that she is severely anemic she also did a fecal test and found that there is blood in her stool she never sees bright red blood though it is not visible to the eye just very dark stool they did a small bowel follow through an endoscopy and a colonoscopy and they still have not found anything her dr said it did not show colitis crohns polyps or celiac is disease but she is still feeling very tired constipated is losing weight very anemic has stomach pain mucus and blood in her stool they put her on prenatal vitamins for the anemia they are now going to do a capsule endoscopy to check more of her small intestine if this was cancer would they have found it by now what else can she do to test for cancer blood tests etc what else could it be,the most common form of neutropenia in infants and young children is transient neutropenia with or following a viral illness it resolves itself within 2 weeks if it lasts longer than that or the child is very ill then a full workup for neutropenia would be recommended in infants aged 2 weeks to 1 year the lower limit of the normal neutrophil count is 1000l after the first year of life the lower limit is 1500l as in adults spontaneous recovery in such cases occurs by age 5 years and the mean duration of neutropenia is approximately 20 months the clinical severity and frequency of infections rather than the severity of neutropenia would be used to determine the further management of the condition hence you should continue to work with the treating doctors for appropriate medical advice i hope this helps,"['small intestine' 'stomach cancer' 'abdominal pain' 'stomach pain'

my mother in law was diagnosed with breast cancer during 3rd stage around dec 2014 post which she underwent chemo followed by removal of the left gland post surgery she underwent radiation therapy for left region and in next follow up she was diagnosed with the cancer spread to her lung and liver around marapr 2015 for this she was prescribed stonger chemo which caused severe side reactions like ulcer appetite loss lose motions etc due to which she discontinued the chemo within 1 month in dec 2016 she has been diagnosed with the cancer spread to her pelvic region now she is having severe back pain and is unable to even change position on bed on her own now she is again undergoing radiation for pelvic region for 11 sessions i know it is pretty late stage but is there any possibility that she can be treated,as all of the clinical data in this area is retrospective in nature i can only comment on what has been published tgus far most of these studies show no significant increase in the risk of congenital abnormalities in children born to women who have previously been treated with chemotherapy and intracranial radiation therapy for leukemia likewise the rate of leukemia recurrence following pregnancy appears to be relatively low although there is always a small risk of delayed recurrence of leukemia with or without pregnancy you should of course discuss your concerns with both your oncologist and your gynecologist before deciding to try and have a child based upon the available evidence however it would appear to be reasonably safe for you to become pregnant if your have been in complete remission for the past 10 years if you do decide to become pregnant then you will have to be carefully monitored for any signs of all recurrence during and after your pregnancy sincerely robert a wascher md facs <link>,"['breast cancer' 'breast' 'cancer' 'radiation therapy' 'radiation'

hi i work full time in a high pressure environment and right now my body and mind are giving me signs indicating that i need a break in my work i have several procedures to follow which are constantly being updated i am having a hard time keeping up as my time is charged to clients i fill in timesheets and i am constantly under pressure to have a minimum of non billable time which is exhausting moreover i have to deal with short deadlines often several simultaneously this is made even heavier by the fact that the instructions i get are not always clear and the people i work for do not seem to grasp the concept of help me help you all this leaves me mentally exhausted today as i am demotivated tired have difficulty concentrating and am feeling like my life is pointless i know i only need a 2 week or so break to recharge my batteries but i do not have any vacations left and cannot afford a leave without pay i am afraid seeing a doctor would only get me a prescription for antidepressants and should i get a prescription for time off i would not want words like burn out or depression on it any advice what is a girl gotta do to get well needed rest without jeopardizing her job or reputation when she does not even appear sick on the outside,burn out is happening in most of the professions nowadays due to the erratic work schedules and tremendous job pressure i can understand your concern you are not depressed it is just anxiety that you are having due to the stressful job i agree with you that taking a few days leave and going for a vacation should prove positive but if you are unable to go for vacation then my advise would be to indulge in yoga and meditation half an hour to one our of yoga and meditation should charge you up for the whole day it would be better if you could join some yoga and meditation classes it is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided for exact diagnosis you are requested to consult your doctor i sincerely hope that helps take care,['depression' 'depression'],1.0
my nephew who is four years has very bad mood swings and stops what he is doing and starts opening and closing of his hands he tells his mother that he wants to break her bones and break the house he goes to the bathroom on the porch and steps in ti and thinks it is funny he is in time out at school 4 out of 5 days and the daycare provider said he needs to be seen by a doctor my sister is so frustrated she does not know what to do other things he does is spit at people hit others punches his mom yells a lot calls eveyone stupid says he wants to hurt animals and people his speech is hard to understand he starts a conversation and be fore he can finish he will stop and talk about something completly different my sister does not know what to do she thinks possible autism what do you think,it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken languageas you said that his speech is hard to understand preoccupation with stereotyped interestas in going to bathroom on the porch the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speechbefore he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology hope this helps take care,"['autism signs' 'autism' 'behavioral disorder' 'early intervention'

i am 35 weeks pregnant and seriously contimplating leaving my husband my pregnancy has been very difficult due to his inability to be completely supportive of me during this time in my 1st tri the cat scratched me and started to become very aggressive toward me hissing etc i asked him to remove the cat but he felt as though it was a shared responsibility & didnt do anything about the cat i couldnt because i didnt want to go near the cat in fear of getting scratched plus it was his cat & i didnt want him resenting me in my 3rd tri she attacked again i got an infenction had to go to the hospital the doh was contacted & he wound up having to take off from work to handle the situation his complaint was that he has to do everything since my 3rd tri he has done some of the grocery shopping to help but refuses to pick up after himself around house he doesnt understand how crazy this makes me and is verbally emotionally abusive when i ask him to wash his dishes saying i am a nag,you seem concerned by the emotional lability during pregnancy along with the feeling that your husband is not supportive and is emotionally and verbally abusing you two main hormones estrogen and progesterone cause mood swings during pregnancy emotions are always unstable and feeling of depression is normal as any other body changes during pregnancy the third trimester is the most anxious one this is the period when mother to be worries about everything and anything that she can think of however her major cause of anxiety lies not just on the labour and delivery process but also in baby care and parenting in general you might be feeling physically uncomfortable with the growth of the abdomen and may feel irritated with the lightest noise as you lack sleep in general it may be more extreme if your partner is unresponsive to your special requirements during pregnancy as he may not realise that the mood swings are normal in pregnancy however if the mood swings of anxiety sadness and anger continuously persist more than two weeks you must meet the practitioner you may be suffering from depression that needs immediate care and attention called bipolar disorder a survey states that untreated emotional health problems can affect your baby is physical well being and increase the risk of preterm labor and postpartum depression get treated with the right psychotherapy and medication for effective results hope this helps take care note this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional,"['pregnancy' 'depression during pregnancy' 'postpartum depression'

my nephew who is four years has very bad mood swings and stops what he is doing and starts opening and closing of his hands he tells his mother that he wants to break her bones and break the house he goes to the bathroom on the porch and steps in ti and thinks it is funny he is in time out at school 4 out of 5 days and the daycare provider said he needs to be seen by a doctor my sister is so frustrated she does not know what to do other things he does is spit at people hit others punches his mom yells a lot calls eveyone stupid says he wants to hurt animals and people his speech is hard to understand he starts a conversation and be fore he can finish he will stop and talk about something completly different my sister does not know what to do she thinks possible autism what do you think,it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken languageas you said that his speech is hard to understand preoccupation with stereotyped interestas in going to bathroom on the porch the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speechbefore he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology hope this helps take care,"['autism signs' 'autism' 'behavioral disorder' 'early intervention'

how to reduce the trigleceride and protien from urea,it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken languageas you said that his speech is hard to understand preoccupation with stereotyped interestas in going to bathroom on the porch the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speechbefore he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology hope this helps take care,['diet' 'atkins diet'],-1.0

hi doc is it advisable to use a therapy machine device to reduce stiffness for 17 month old baby,you seem concerned about the stiffness in your 17 month old baby diagnosed with cerebral palsy cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child is movement and muscle coordination gets impaired however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use hisher hands to stand up to stand and to walk ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parentscarers to enhance the child is ability and function the aims of the treatment are goal orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation treatment is planned for each child via assessment some of the areas that will be assessed are â¢ the patterns of movement the child presents with â¢ age appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult â¢ the child is present capabilities â¢ examination of the child is posture in different situations and positions once the child has been assessed a prioritized problem solving list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas positioning is very important in bobath treatment correct positioning helps improve movements experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of key points on the child is body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines hope this helps take care note this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional,"['cerebral palsy' 'health care' 'treatments' 'treatment' 'diagnosis'

hi i am from new delhi india my dad was diagnosed with inoperable stage 4 metastatic pancreatic cancer on 12032012 while he was in operation theater doctor stop the operation now they are saying only kemo will help my dad was supposed to have the wipple procedure but when the doctors opened him up they saw that the cancer had already spread to his liver the surgeon did not remove the tumor on his pancreas or liver and just closed him back up my understanding that there are 8 to 10 small mets on his liver that look like small rice like granules i believe they are isolated to only one lobe of the liver we were told that chemotherapy was our only option at this point but given that it is only a palliative measure so we are obviously looking for other viable options pl help me my father is at 65yrs & fit n fine before this operation he will be going to discharged frm hospital on 20 03 12 then cemo will start on 28 03 2012 pl pl please help me what to do i was devastated to learn that the surgeon did not remove the tumor on the head of his pancreas the surgeon said that he left the tumor there so my uncle could begin chemotherapy sooner i do not understand why he would leave that ticking time bomb inside of him and it pains me to know that it is still inside him and growing even as i type this post thanks gagan gdhawan1981@gmail com,hi gagan welcome to the ehealthforum and i am really glad to help you out i can understand your concern for your uncle but the surgeon was absolutely right in abandoning the whipple is procedure on seeing the metastasis to the liver once the tumor has metastasized to the liver it becomes a stage 4 pancreatic cancer unfortunately majority of the patients do not live more than 6 months and only a few survive up to one year once the diagnosis is confirmed the only option available presently is chemotherapy i sincerely hope that helps take care,"['cancer' 'liver' 'chemotherapy' 'diagnosis' 'procedure' 'tumor' 'head'

i am 26 years old i had met an motor bike accident 1 year ago where i fracture my right leg it was a kind of simple open compound fracture surgery was done & nail rod were placed there i have followed the doctor & do every things he said but bone healing does not occur instead the nail start breaking after i start walking without crutches the doctor added extra calcium supplements & waited further but no changes then i move to next hospital after 8 month a prp injection was given saying it was a non union & waited to see the reaction no good changes then after 11 month again surgery was done replacing the broken nail with another long & wider nailrod some changes were observed within 4 months then dynamization of nailing along with prp inject was made recently will it solve the problem what are the chances how long it will take to heal can i walk without support as it has been 4 month alreadyexcept recent dynamization,the healing of a fractured bone depends on many factors 1 type of fracture   compound fractures   take much longer to heal 2 displaced bone fragments   if the bone edges and parts have been displaced then the risk of delayed union and nonunion increase 3 infection   increases the healing time 4 disruption of the blood flow to the fracture site   also hampers healing 5 malnutrition bone disorders also prolong the healing time 6 early mobilization of the joint   before complete healing in your case you have 2 or more factors which have caused the delay in your recovery without first hand knowledge of your current condition examination of your xrays and a physical examination it would not be possible to give exact possibility of your prognosis i am sorry about that but platelet rich plasma prp does contain important cytokines and growth factors which when injected into a injured area helps to improve the rate of healing bone formation in your case and hence your recovery as mentioned in your history you may already might have had some progress hence if the fractured bone site heals completely which will eventually happen in due time   there is no doubt that you will be able to walk normally on the affected foot i hope this helps,['recovery' 'broken bones'],1.0

my son is now nineteen months old and doesnt say any words at all he jabbers a lot but you can not understand any of it he seems very normal otherwise he plays and laughs and smiles i have read things about how autistic children do not hold eye contact he can and does we have a seven year old son as well and i do not remember it taking this long for him to talk should i be concerned that he may be autistic i am a nervous wreck over this,autism is a medical condition in which there are problems with communication and social interaction this is a rather serious condition to be diagnosed without a complex and complete examination the child might lack eye contact as you mentioned the babbling in these children might be accompanied with unusual gestures repeating othersâ words whereas the words are less frequently associated with appropriate gestures repetitive behaviour might be one of the symptoms that are most easy to recognize it might include compulsive behaviour ritualistic behaviour stereotypy or even self injury as for the slow improvement of the speech please consider that many children just need more time to talk and to be understood different conditions might be causing this situation sometimes the child might need help from a specialist for speech and language therapy whom you are advised to visit she might be able to detect if there are any physiological problems with the speech related organs the tongue the palate the throat or the child simply needs more time to develop the speech to exclude autism you might want to take your child to a neuropsychologist pediatrician until than please keep in mind that there are many children at the age of 19 months whose speech is not fluent enough to be understood clearly,"['symptoms' 'autism' 'autism symptoms of' 'pediatrician'

hi there i am 40 years old male and married i have been diagnosed to have a papillary thyroid cancer stage 1 t1n0m0 i have undergone near total thyroidectomy  a portion of the left lobe was left a month ago my endo prescribed levothyroxin for me to take for two to three months i approached another endo and he has a slightly different view on treatment after surgery i am weighing my options whether to go on with radioactive iodine treatment or not suppose i will not undergo rai treatment what other possible options do i have what are the risks and if i go for rai what are the possible health risks will it affect memory other organs like kidney sexual desire etc the surgery did not include removal of any lymph node this is the biopsyright thyroid lobe and isthmus nodular papillary adenocarcinoma of low grade malignant potential left thyroid lobe colloid goiter solitary parathyroid gland with no significant histopathology demonstated thanks for the answers,radioactive iodine rai is often chosen for treatment of conditions associated with overactive thyroid including hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancers rai treatment is based on the fact that the thyroid actively accumulates iodine which it uses to produce thyroid hormones required for normal body function the therapeutic action of rai is via disruption of the function of the thyroid cells   the more radioactive iodine given the more cells cease to function as the cells stop functioning excessive amounts of thyroid hormones are no longer produced and symptoms of hyperthyroidism begin to disappear in your case the side effects of such therapy will be limited to short term effects like sore throat nausea fatigue etc there will be no effect on other organs like kidneys nor any effect on the sexual desire and sexual function but once the treatment is completed you will need lifelong therapy with thyroxine supplements to prevent hypothyroidism related symptoms,"['thyroid cancer' 'thyroid' 'cancer' 'adenocarcinoma' 'sexual desire'

i have been in a 4months and 6 days treatment for ptb i have this concern because every morning when i spit i always see thick white mucus or a thick yellowish mucus i am very concerned whether my treatment was a failure because there is one time that i had forgotten one dosage of my medicine for one day i am having a hard time going to the hospitalhealth centers because i live in a far flung area any advice if my treatment was a failure or not i am gaining weight and already freed from restlessness in breathing i also cough but not like coughing before as if i were dying i will be waiting for answers thanks in advance,this is a very difficult question to answer on net as this will require detailed psychiatric examination however since all the 3 psychiatrist you saw felt the need to prescribe medications it is quite clear that you need some medication to help prevent relapse or maybe there are some lingering symptoms that need to be controlled you can also try psychotherapy along with medications it may be helpful to discuss these points with the psychiatrist you trust the most hope this helps take care,['healthcare it' 'tuberculosis'],-1.0
for about two years now i have been having a problem with my ears i know this will probably sound really weird but here is what is been happening i have had muffled hearing and my ears have felt stuffy both ears the biggest issue is that when i place my finger just inside my ear canal and apply some pressure and release there is a very loud crackling and popping sound it last for 1 or 2 seconds then stops in both ears the same i can even feel it bubbling inside my ear it sounds and feels like some type of fluid,from the description provided it seems that you may be having a condition called as glue ear or serous otitis media serous otitis media describes a collection of fluid in the middle ear this may be acute not lasting for a long time or chronic lasting for a long time chronic long standing otitis media as in your case can occur due to long standing eustachian tube blockage or thickening of fluid due to which it cannot be absorbed or drained down the tube symptoms can range from ear discomfort pain slight reduction in hearing and irritation treatment of the condition can be done with medications including antihistamines and decongestants and nasal sprays in long standing cases a small surgical procedure involving placement of a ear tube in the ear drum tympanic membrane may be required to facilitate drainage of the fluid you might consult with your primary doctor or a ent doctor who can examine you and provide specific advice and treatment i hope this helps,['tmj' 'hearing' 'apply' 'ear' 'tmj'],1.0

i just got 2 piercings done like 5 days ago my cartilage and in between the cartilage and lobe piercings i have i am experiencing some swelling in the back of my ear where the back piece is i clean it 3 times a day but it all of a sudden started hurting at the moment it is kinda throbbing where the piercing is it is a little warm and when i touch it it hurts it makes me wanna take out my piercing,it may have been infected the signs suggest that its possible that small abcess is made the piercing should be taken out the ear examined and if there is abcess with pus that should be drained and of its inflammation then proper antibiotics should be used to clear infection this can infection can lead to infection of the cartilage so it should be taken seriously hope it helps thanks,['body modification'],1.0

hi i have recently undergone a vasectomy and after 1 sample i was asked to do another after putting my second sample in the urologist has asked to see me face to face in 7 days time im not sure if this is normal and i have worked myself up about this thinking they may have detected something in my sample showing something serious like prostate cancer since the procedure i have had little aches and pains in my left testicle which i assumed was normal and may very well be ive also had a bit of a dull ache in my lower left back which comes and goes i may not even notice this for days should i be worried about them calling me in they have not said its urgent or asked me to take someone in is it normal to be asked to see your urologist after a result,semen analysis is not suitable to diagnose prostate ca azoospermia has to be established before declaring sterility this re testing is most likely a part of that very protocol to detect any viable number that could lead to impregnation though vasectomy is very safe method and only 1  failure rate is there retesting at three weeks is ideal to confirm azoospermia wishing you best of health thanks,['cancer' 'prostate cancer' 'prostate health' 'testicular cancer'],1.0
